# CAPTCHA SERVICE

### INTRODUCTION

A CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) service is a security tool designed to distinguish between human users and automated bots. By presenting challenges that are easy for people but difficult for machines—such as identifying distorted text, selecting specific objects in images, or simple interaction patterns—these services protect websites from spam, brute-force attacks, and data scraping.
